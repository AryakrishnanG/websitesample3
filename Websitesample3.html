          <h2>CHICKEN</h2>
          This dish was introduced to the Caribbean by indentured Indian girmitya workers. At that time, the dish was very similar to the chicken curry dish of India, consisting mostly of sauce with few chicken pieces. However, poultry in Trinidad and Tobago was so readily available, the dish began consisting of mainly chicken, flavored with curry spices. Typical preparation include washing and then seasoning and marinating the chicken meat in a green seasoning consisting of bhandhania, dhania, pudina, thyme, scallion, onion, garlic, and peppers. Then the curry is prepared by first adding oil to the pot and then adding the phoran, which in the Caribbean consist of caripoulé, cut-up onions, peppers, and tomatoes, and garlic paste (some add ginger too). Some may also add saunf, jeera and meethi seeds along with the phoran. Then Madras curry powder (some also additionally add garam masala or any other masala they wish), mixed with water and green seasoning is added to the pot and fried up with the phoran in the oil, in a process known as bunjay or bujna. Then the marinated chicken is added to the pot and salt, black pepper, and sometimes roasted jeera powder is added. At this point aloo, pigeon peas, channa, or baigan is sometimes added. Then it is left to cook for 15–20 minutes on medium heat. Afterwards, water (some additionally add coconut milk) is added to make the soorwah or sauce/gravy and it is brought to a boil on lower to medium heat for 5–10 minutes. It is usually served with paratha or dalpuri roti or with dal bhat (dal and rice).[4] Curry chicken and its derivatives are also popular in Suriname, Guyana, Jamaica, and other Caribbean territories with Indian and South Asian influence.
